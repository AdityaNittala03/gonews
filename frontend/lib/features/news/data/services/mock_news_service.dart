Foreign investors have pumped in over â‚¹45,000 crores in the past month, showing renewed confidence in Indian equities. The banking sector was the biggest gainer, with HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and SBI posting significant gains. IT stocks also performed well, benefiting from strong demand for digital services and favorable currency movements. Analysts remain optimistic about the market's outlook, citing strong domestic consumption, government infrastructure spending, and India's position as a preferred investment destination.

After losing the first Test, India bounced back with three consecutive victories, showcasing the depth and resilience of the squad. Young batting sensation Yashasvi Jaiswal emerged as the series' leading run-scorer with 487 runs, while pace bowler Mohammed Siraj claimed 21 wickets to top the bowling charts. Captain Rohit Sharma praised the team's fighting spirit and the contribution of the support staff in preparing the players for Australian conditions. The series victory was built on exceptional batting performances, disciplined bowling, and some brilliant fielding displays. Veteran spinner Ravichandran Ashwin played a crucial role in the spin-friendly conditions, while the pace attack of Siraj, Bumrah, and Shami consistently troubled the Australian batsmen. This victory cements India's position as the number one Test team in the world and sets up an exciting year of cricket ahead with the World Test Championship final approaching.",

The government has allocated \$2.4 billion for this mission, positioning India to become a global leader in clean energy transition. The mission aims to reduce the cost of green hydrogen production, create employment opportunities, and significantly reduce carbon emissions. Key components include establishing Green Hydrogen Hubs, providing production incentives, and developing a robust supply chain ecosystem. Major industrial players including Reliance Industries, Adani Group, and Tata Motors have announced significant investments in green hydrogen projects. The mission is expected to create over 600,000 jobs and attract investments worth \$100 billion by 2030. States like Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu are emerging as key centers for green hydrogen production due to their renewable energy potential. This initiative aligns with India's commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070 and strengthens the country's energy security while reducing dependence on fossil fuel imports.",

          "Reserve Bank of India maintains status quo on policy rates while adopting a neutral stance on monetary policy amid inflation concerns.",
      "content":
          "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.5% for the eighth consecutive time, while shifting its monetary policy stance from 'withdrawal of accommodation' to 'neutral'. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das explained that this decision was taken considering the current inflation trajectory and the need to support economic growth. The central bank revised its inflation projection for FY25 to 4.8% from the earlier estimate of 4.5%, citing concerns over food price volatility and geopolitical uncertainties. However, the GDP growth forecast for FY25 was maintained at 7.2%, reflecting confidence in India's economic fundamentals. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 4-2 in favor of keeping rates unchanged, with two members advocating for a rate cut to support growth. Banking sector analysts believe this pause provides stability for borrowers while allowing banks to manage their net interest margins effectively. The neutral stance indicates that the RBI is prepared to adjust policy in either direction based on evolving economic conditions. Market participants now expect the next policy review to focus more on growth considerations if inflation remains within the target range.",
